                My programming journey started back when I was in school. I was
                involved with robotics and arduino and that's when I got
                introduced to programming. I knew what coding was and what it
                does but it did not grab my attention back then.
                <br />
                <br />
                After my 10th boards I chose Science stream with Electronics
                being one of the subjects. I was thrilled to learn about how
                everyday devices like Sensors, Mobiles, Computers worked. I
                wanted to explore this field more and that's why I chose
                Electronics and Communication Engineering as my discipline.
                <br /> <br />
                In First Year I learnt Python and C/C++ programming. That's when
                I decided to explore this domain more. I realised how much work
                goes behind making the apps and websites we use everyday. Then I
                started taking programming a bit more seriously as I realised
                its potential. I started with DSA and Problem Solving and
                started Web Development alongside. This website is my first
                ReactJS project!ðŸ˜ƒ
